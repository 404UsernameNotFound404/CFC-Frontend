                        In 2011, Henry and Daxton first got involved
                        <br />in activism. They learned about past and present
                        <br />injustices facing Indigenous communities, and wanted
                        <br />to take action. They had a lot of support from their teachers,
                        <br />and from groups like the First Nations Child and Family Caring
                        <br />Society. By 2017 both Henry and Daxton were noticing that many
                        <br />people wanted to learn more, and get more involved, but did not have
                        <br />the same support they had received, or did not know how to take action.
                        <br />This is when the idea of Connecting for Change was born. This websiteâ€™s
                        <br />purpose is to help like-minded people connect and join forces to fight injustice.
